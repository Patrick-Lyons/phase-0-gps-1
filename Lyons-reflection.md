#Patrick Lyons Reflection#
###for GPS 1.1###

1. Prior to the GPS, I struggled a bit with the concept of merge conflicts. I also did not have the best workflow. Biggest room in the world? Room for improvement.

2. The concept of merge conflicts, and also just general GitHub work flow, were clarified in the GPS. But I'll needs to do some practice on my own to truly get it. I'm a slow--but steady--study.

3. I asked the guide about the difference between commands that seem to do the same thing, like 
```
git fetch origin master
```
vs.
```
git pull
```

4. I still need to get good Git and GitHub workflow down, and I still need to wrap my head around the concept of branching off and dealing with branches. It still feels like it can get messy for me. I'll have to keep messing around with it.

5. It was a good first experience. I was a little anxious going into it but the guide, John, was great and we were able to jump right into the work.
